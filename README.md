# Coffee-Shop-Sales
I completed a project on Coffee Shop Sales Analysis using Excel and advanced Excel concepts. In this project, I analyzed and created a dashboard using Power Query, Measures, Pivot Charts, Slicers, etc.

First and foremost, I cleaned the data in Power Query Editor by removing blanks, changing data types, adding new columns, etc. After that, I loaded the data and added it to the data model. Then, I created pivot tables based on the data.

I created several pivot charts, including:
Hourly quantity sale, Weekdays sale, Sale based on Product category, Monthly sale, Sales of top 5 Product type, Preferace based on product size, Sale and Footfall based on location, Total revenue based on product details, Footfall based on days.
Based on the pivot chart I created the dashboard for better visualization by using bar chart, column chart, pie chart, line chart.

From this overall analysis, I concluded the top 5 product types based on sales, sales on weekdays and hourly basis, total sales revenue each month, total footfall in each coffee shop location, peak times for sales, and sales variation across different locations.
